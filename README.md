# SpotifyAssistantR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

In this project, we aim to create a package in R that builds on top of the spotifyr package and offers more useful features to improve the Spotify user experience. 

This is achieved by utilizing REST APIs to implement the functions. Additionally, our package will combine multiple requests from the spotifyR package to provide additional insights for Spotify users.

## Installation

You can install the development version of SpotifyAssistantR like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github('UBC-MDS/SpotifyAssistantR')
```

## Dependencies

We use spotifyR package to authenticate (getting and refreshing access tokens), acquire data and get user-specific information.
Install spotifyR with:

```r
install.packages('spotifyr')
```

## Environment Setup

To use the package we require you to supplement the client id and client secret in order to acquire token:

```r
Sys.setenv(SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx')
Sys.setenv(SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx')

access_token <- get_spotify_access_token()
```
This must be provided after loading the spotifyr library and before using the package. 

## Usage

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(SpotifyAssistantR)
get_new_releases_by_continent(country_code='Asia', n_limit=3)
# [[1]]
# [1] "Renegade"
# 
# [[2]]
# [1] "LANDER"
# 
# [[3]]
# [1] "Dreaming of You"
```

## Functions

- `get_users_top_genres()`: Returns the top 5 genres of music that a user listens to and has saved in the "Your Music" library.
- `get_song_recommendations(playlist_name, num_songs)`: Creates a playlist of recommended songs based on userâ€™s top 3 artists.
- `get_playlists_songs(playlists)`: Returns the songs saved in all the playlists, which are passed as a list to the function.
- `get_new_releases_by_continent(continent, limit)`: Returns the new releases by continent
